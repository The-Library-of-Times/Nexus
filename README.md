# ***The Library of Times***
Well then hello, and welcome to *The Library of Times*.
A collection of stories and tales that connect the past, present, and future... the unknown, with facts and fantasy... the passion, with power and wisdom.
This Library is, at all stakes, a fascinating adventure which you've just joined, and where I invite you to, at your very best, enjoy with all of your heart.
My name is Saga, and I will be guiding you throughout this process of discovery, analysis and, of course, reading.
This space is called the *Nexus* as it connects the remaining chambers and rooms of our beloved library.
## Chambers in The Library
Our Library is composed of five main chambers:
1. [**The Stream of Tales**](./README.md):

This beautiful space is designed for the stories created for the youngest family members, where the kids can join and enjoy the tales, fables and adventures that are tailored for their big, creative minds.

2. [**Voices of the Future**](./README.md):

In a youthful, but deeper aspect, there's a juvenile public, who seek most of the answers, who do not settle for a "*it's just like that*" for an answer. Scientists of the daily living as they quickly grow on their way to adulthood while dealing with every single bit of it. This section is for them.

3. [**Chronicles of Legends**](./README.md):

*Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it*. The saying goes... The stories and texts contained in here are made from the honey that can be squeezed out of the comb that's been made of events in time.

4. [**Shadows & Whispers**](./README.md):

In a much more mature sense, if you are not afraid of going deeper in our shelves, this is the spot you might be heeding.

5. [**The Visionary Gaze**](./README.md):

Is the future written? certainly, it is a difficult question to answer. This collection contains analysis, words of wisdom, expectations for the future and many other inspirations.

Expecting that our humble space serves your curiosity and, hopefully, fulfills your entertainment, please be kind and share the joy with others.
Enjoy your stay,

*Saga*
